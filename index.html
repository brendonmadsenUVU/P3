I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.

The project was good. This was more of a personal project that I fit into the requirements
and I had a lot of fun making it. Im not sure if my design is great for media queries for
tablets and phones but I think it does ok.

                        <p>Dark and Darker player Stouty shows off his skills wiping out full teams by himself. As a top ranked melee slasher player he has no problems fighting outnumbered. With good use of shield potions and positioning he effortlessly goes head to head with rouges, clerics, barbarians and anything else that stands in his way.</p>

                        <p>Currently there is only one map in the game with levels 2 and 3 implemented. Ironmace has announced that level 1 will be available to play during the next playtest. Level 1 will have a max player capacity above 30 with many oppurtunities for escape portals. The mobs in this level will be easier to kill at the trade off of lower quality loot than the current level offering. This will be a welcomed improvement as many players have expressed their grief at the diffuculty of level 2.</p>
